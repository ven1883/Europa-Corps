  <entitydescription.scp_mxa1warsky>A modified Coalition Caseless Assault Rifle that appears to have been very heavily used by its original owner. The phrase 'Beta mayor got trashed.' has been etched onto the left side of the lower receiver.</entitydescription.scp_mxa1warsky>
  <entityname.scp_ash12unique>Protectorate Oppressor Battle Rifle </entityname.scp_ash12unique>
  <entitydescription.scp_ash12unique>An Oppressor Battle Rifle heavily modified by a Protectorate, having a custom gas tube for a significantly higher fire rate and a custom muzzle brake to mitigate the added recoil somewhat.</entitydescription.scp_ash12unique>
  <entityname.scp_hk21>Maschinegewehr</entityname.scp_hk21>
  <entitydescription.scp_hk21>A small and lighter 7.62x51mm Machine Gun that appears to have been left abandoned for a long time.</entitydescription.scp_hk21>
  <entityname.scp_sa80a3>Imperialist</entityname.scp_sa80a3>
  <entitydescription.scp_sa80a3>A 6.5x39mm Assault Rifle based on a British design with a bullpup configuration, providing greater accuracy and velocity, though noticably increases recoil.</entitydescription.scp_sa80a3>
  <entityname.scp_g3ka4>Sturmgewehr</entityname.scp_g3ka4>
  <entitydescription.scp_g3ka4>A compact 7.62x51mm Battle Rifle utilising a roller delayed blowback operation for more reliable cycling, however requires an overall heavier bolt to accomplish, increasing recoil impulses.</entitydescription.scp_g3ka4>
  <entityname.scp_m29>Lucky Punk</entityname.scp_m29>
  <entitydescription.scp_m29>An old 10.9x33mm revolver that looks relatively well kept.</entitydescription.scp_m29>
  <entityname.scp_r8>Pocket 8 Shooter</entityname.scp_r8>
  <entitydescription.scp_r8>A 9x33mm revolver using a larger frame and an 8 round cylinder for slightly greater volume of fire.</entitydescription.scp_r8>
  <entityname.scp_spas12>Franchi</entityname.scp_spas12>
  <entitydescription.scp_spas12>A blocky 12 gauge shotgun with no stock, though is able to quickly empty its tube at anything unfortunate enough to be close.</entitydescription.scp_spas12>
  <entityname.scp_akms>Avtomat</entityname.scp_akms>
  <entitydescription.scp_akms>A very old looking 7.62x39mm rifle using a very uncomfortable folding stock and primitive muzzle brake. The wood handguard is in surprisingly good shape given where it came from.</entitydescription.scp_akms>
  <entityname.scp_m16a3>Stormer</entityname.scp_m16a3>
  <entitydescription.scp_m16a3>An old and battle worn 5.56x45mm Assault Rifle that looks heavily used by it's previous owner and features a 40mm Grenade Launcher.</entitydescription.scp_m16a3>

  <entitydescription.scp_pkm>A very old looking 7.62x51mm GPMG, with a custom lightweight bolt carrier and expanded gas tube allowing for a significantly higher fire rate.</entitydescription.scp_pkm>
  <entityname.scp_g17>Gaston</entityname.scp_g17>
  <entitydescription.scp_g17>A rather blocky but reliable 9x19mm pistol, evidently being an older design of self-loading pistol. It has kept surprisingly intact despite it's apparent age.</entitydescription.scp_g17>
  <entityname.scp_rsh50>Hand Breaker</entityname.scp_rsh50>
  <entitydescription.scp_rsh50>A 12.7x99mm Assault Revolver that has been modified to take Anti-Materiel Cartridges, who did this and why is unknown given the immense recoil.</entitydescription.scp_rsh50>
  <entityname.scp_domique>Domique</entityname.scp_domique>
  <entitydescription.scp_domique>A very old 12 gauge shotgun using the first prototype of dual environment bolt systems, it was a standard issue gun for security until more capable firearms were adapted and produced.</entitydescription.scp_domique>
  <entityname.scp_g36c>Karabiner</entityname.scp_g36c>
  <entitydescription.scp_g36c>A 5.56x45mm Assault Carbine that was once used by the Coalition, however the Separatists used this design for their Precision AR.</entitydescription.scp_g36c>
  <entityname.sgt_boknife>Durasteel-Incendium Alloy Knife</entityname.sgt_boknife>
  <entitydescription.sgt_boknife>A durasteel tactical blade with an Incendium edge, slashing causes an extreme temperature change on contact, often gashing through materials with little resistance.</entitydescription.sgt_boknife>
  <entityname.sgt_f2k>Coalition Suppressed Assault Rifle</entityname.sgt_f2k>
  <entitydescription.sgt_f2k>A highly unusual looking suppressed 5.56x45mm rifle featuring an unconventional ejection system and somewhat alien shape, alongside having a full rifle length barrel in a more compact package. Produced for Black Ops who require a covert weapon that uses more available ammunition.</entitydescription.sgt_f2k>
  <entityname.sgt_xms>Coalition Covert Combat Rifle</entityname.sgt_xms>
  <entitydescription.sgt_xms>An odd rifle loading the natively subsonic 9x39, it squeezes every bit of extra energy for the round, giving it more power and armor piercing. It's cyclical rate is somewhat low, designed to keep it little more than a hoarse whisper, to the preference of Black-Ops Operatives.</entitydescription.sgt_xms>
  <entityname.sgt_vhs>Coalition Suppressed Battle Rifle</entityname.sgt_vhs>
  <entitydescription.sgt_vhs>Loading 7.62x51, Coalition Black-Ops teams needed something with more "Knockdown Potential," in a more compact package. The bullpup design was used to keep the weapon relatively small and light, alongside integral suppressors to mask their presence when deep in enemy territory. The weapon uses a quick 4-round burst firemode to help with overall accuracy, and reduce ammunition waste.</entitydescription.sgt_vhs>
  <entityname.sgt_m90t>Coalition Assault Shotgun</entityname.sgt_m90t>
  <entitydescription.sgt_m90t>Designed for multi-role, the Assault Shotgun has a long and complicated service history. Sporting the 8-Gauge shell, it has a nasty habit of breaking faces, doors, and the occasional shoulder, as it's recoil is unforgiving, though there are some who take no less for traitors.</entitydescription.sgt_m90t>
  <entityname.sgt_dbs>Renegade Assault Shotgun</entityname.sgt_dbs>
  <entitydescription.sgt_dbs>A retooled Double-Barrel shotgun, favored by Veterans of any side for it's reliability and commanding feel. With the ability to quickly drop both 8-Gauge shells in a moments notice, it often gets used in a defensive manner, as exchanging shells takes a while-too-long for gunfights.</entitydescription.sgt_dbs>
  <entityname.sgt_gunslinger>Renegade Light Hand Cannon</entityname.sgt_gunslinger>
  <entitydescription.sgt_gunslinger>A 10.9x33mmR Single-Action revolver, great choice for self-defense, due to it's light trigger pull, but requires the hammer to be drawn back for every subsequent shot. However, the simplicity allows for single-handed use, and more skilled individuals can re-balance it in their hands faster, allowing for quicker shots.</entitydescription.sgt_gunslinger>
  <entityname.sgt_levergun>Service Repeater</entityname.sgt_levergun>
  <entitydescription.sgt_levergun>A 9x29mm rifle utilizing a very old lever action system that is heavily outdated compared to most firearms on Europa. Despite the inherent antiquity, it is favoured by Coalition captains and citizens for making a rather puny cartridge more viable with it's longer barrel and 9 round tube.</entitydescription.sgt_levergun>
  <entityname.sgt_heavyblaster>Heavy Blaster</entityname.sgt_heavyblaster>
  <entitydescription.sgt_heavyblaster>An attempt at generalized Man-Portable Laser Weaponry, the clunky "Rifle" needs single-shot disposable cells to fire, due to it's output load required to discharge.</entitydescription.sgt_heavyblaster>
  <entityname.sgt_asmd>Blaster Rifle</entityname.sgt_asmd>
  <entitydescription.sgt_asmd>A more mobile, but unforgiving variant of the Heavy Blaster, allowing a shot to ring instantaniously, but requiring a timely recharge afterwards. Useful for "Fragging" groups of tightly-packed targets.</entitydescription.sgt_asmd>
  <entityname.sgt_bolter>Prototype Oppressor Battle Carbine</entityname.sgt_bolter>
  <entitydescription.sgt_bolter>A short rifle that runs on 12.7x55 by means of magazines. It adapts upon the Coalition's favored Oppressor Battle Rifle, built into a smaller package while increasing efficiency of gas usage, allowing it to top-out at a higher rate of fire. This also causes it to jump violently, oftentimes injuring untrained users.</entitydescription.sgt_bolter>
  <entityname.sgt_ppr>Prototype Precision Rifle</entityname.sgt_ppr>
  <entitydescription.sgt_ppr>A semi-automatic 8.6x70mm rifle that neatly fits the Designated Marksman role, it has the ability to force through the majority of helmets and vests, while being quick enough for follow-up shots, in the case that one isn't enough.</entitydescription.sgt_ppr>
  <entityname.sgt_chemthrower>Heavy Chemthrower</entityname.sgt_chemthrower>
  <entitydescription.sgt_chemthrower>A large, bulky flamethrower designed by the Coalition to incinerate the most hardy of flora and fauna alike, the specialised chemical fuel reaching up to over 900 degrees and having significantly better range. However it's bulk makes it extremely difficult for a poorly trained user to operate.</entitydescription.sgt_chemthrower>
  <entityname.heavyshotshell>8-Gauge Shotgun Shell</entityname.heavyshotshell>
  <entitydescription.heavyshotshell>Packed with 12 Steel pellets, the shell has a tendancy to take off doors and limbs alike. It does a better job punching through lighter armor than it's lesser counterpart, though can still make a mess of heavier plate.</entitydescription.heavyshotshell>
  <entityname.heavyhotshell>8-Gauge Incendiary Shell</entityname.heavyhotshell>
  <entitydescription.heavyhotshell>Stocked with magnesium shreds, it spreads violently with a hot mess of sparks, usually leaving targets heavily charred.</entitydescription.heavyhotshell>
  <entityname.heavystunshell>8-Gauge Riot Shotgun Shell</entityname.heavystunshell>
  <entitydescription.heavystunshell>Seated with 4 rubber balls, other non-lethal options are suggested for unskilled users, with heavy recoil still being present.</entitydescription.heavystunshell>
  <entityname.heavysliceshell>8-Gauge "Shredder" Slug Shotgun Shell</entityname.heavysliceshell>
  <entitydescription.heavysliceshell>Contains a Titanium fragmenting slug that causes immense bleeding on target, even through heavy armor.</entitydescription.heavysliceshell>
  <entityname.glshotshell>40mm Grenade Shotshell</entityname.glshotshell>
  <entitydescription.glshotshell>Using 24 Steel BB's, the shell's the "short-range" option for explosive specialists to clear paths in-front of them without harming themselves in the process.</entitydescription.glshotshell>
  <entityname.sgt_bosmg>Coalition Suppressed Heavy SMG</entityname.sgt_bosmg>
  <entitydescription.sgt_bosmg>A 11.43x23 SMG with an extreme firerate and integral suppressor, it's favored by Black-Ops Scouts for its quick knock-down and ammo availablity, though it has a nasty habit of running through ammo very quickly, leading to users firing in short, controlled bursts</entitydescription.sgt_bosmg>
  <entityname.sgt_arpistol>Prototype Short-Barreled Rifle</entityname.sgt_arpistol>
  <entitydescription.sgt_arpistol>Chambered in the intermediate 5.56x45, it has native armor piercing and capacity over any other pistol, but at the cost of a larger profile.</entitydescription.sgt_arpistol>
  <entityname.sgt_usp>Coalition Assault Pistol</entityname.sgt_usp>
  <entitydescription.sgt_usp>A boxy looking 10x25mm handgun, being favoured by most Coalition operators for it's substantially better power and penetration than both 9x19 and 11.43x23 pistols. Such power however comes at the cost of a heavy pistol and significant recoil impulses that most shooters can't handle.</entitydescription.sgt_usp>
  <entityname.sgt_mk23>Covert Assault Pistol</entityname.sgt_mk23>
  <entitydescription.sgt_mk23>A 10x25mm combat pistol, with integrated light and suppressor for use by Coalition Black-Ops. Needing something maneuverable, but hardy to keep as backup, the employment of more expensive alloys helps to lighten the overall weapon without compromising reliability.</entitydescription.sgt_mk23>
  <entityname.sgt_n99>The Wanderer</entityname.sgt_n99>
  <entitydescription.sgt_n99>This 10x25mm pistol has seen some better days, with dents and scratches from every discernable source, but just as reliable as ever. Recoil is extremely manageable, so don't worry about a Kick in the Head.</entitydescription.sgt_n99>
  <entityname.sgt_auto10>Prototype Assault Pistol</entityname.sgt_auto10>
  <entitydescription.sgt_auto10>An unorthodox 10x25mm design, with ported barrel and weight distribution for ease of handling during firing. It fires in 2-round bursts to maximize rounds on target, with it doing nothing more but a gentle bounce during its' function.</entitydescription.sgt_auto10>
  <entityname.sgt_apc>Coalition Assault SMG</entityname.sgt_apc>
  <entitydescription.sgt_apc>Loaded in 10x25mm, the weapon is often favored by boarding parties and ship defense crews for the quick output of damage, while the chunky design and stock mitigate the recoil considerably. The magwell accepts both extended and standard magazine types.</entitydescription.sgt_apc>
  <entityname.sgt_hpp>Renegade Assault Pistol</entityname.sgt_hpp>
  <entitydescription.sgt_hpp>Designed to fire 10x25mm, the "Plastic Pistol" has lead weights in its' slide to cycle properly, giving it a weighty feel, though doing nothing for the recoil.</entitydescription.sgt_hpp>
  <entityname.sgt_hpc>Renegade Assault SMG</entityname.sgt_hpc>
  <entitydescription.sgt_hpc>Firing 10x25mm, it took the design for the Assault Pistol, added a stock, and extended the barrel, allowing for more accurate fire from less skilled individuals.</entitydescription.sgt_hpc>
  <entityname.sgt_pasmg>Prototype Assault SMG</entityname.sgt_pasmg>
  <entitydescription.sgt_pasmg>A brisk-paced 10x25mm submachine gun with a specialty design, it sacrifices speed for accuracy, leaving the user open to close combat during operations. Though, it seems the 8-Gauge underbarrel was the solution to save this Alien of a weapon.</entitydescription.sgt_pasmg>
  <entityname.sgt_m79>Renegade Compact Grenade Launcher</entityname.sgt_m79>
  <entitydescription.sgt_m79>A short-and-simple 40mm grenade launcher, used by boarding crews to displace crowds and devastate rooms before lead starts flying. Made for use by one hand.</entitydescription.sgt_m79>
  <entityname.sgt_napalm>Chemfuel Canister</entityname.sgt_napalm>
  <entitydescription.sgt_napalm>A high density flammable fuel mixture, designed specifically for the Chemthrower to start an inferno.</entitydescription.sgt_napalm>
  <entityname.sgt_hbcell>Heavy Blaster Cell</entityname.sgt_hbcell>
  <entitydescription.sgt_hbcell>Disposable High-Amp Supercapacitor designed for the Heavy Blaster. Better made cells can get more shots before the entropy destroys it.</entitydescription.sgt_hbcell>
  <entityname.sgt_hbcell2>Heavy Blaster Multi-Pulse Cell</entityname.sgt_hbcell2>
  <entitydescription.sgt_hbcell2>Disposable High-Amp Supercapacitor designed for the Heavy Blaster. Having the diodes aligned in series instead of parallel lets the pulse divide, while also increasing the max overall damage due to less strain on the lenses.</entitydescription.sgt_hbcell2>
  <entityname.sgt_10mmmag>Assault Pistol Magazine</entityname.sgt_10mmmag>
  <entitydescription.sgt_10mmmag>Holding 10 rounds of 10x25mm, the cartidge has a few fans due to native AP abilities, but the wrist-wrecking recoil will deter some users.</entitydescription.sgt_10mmmag>
  <entityname.sgt_10mmmagext>Assault Pistol Extended Magazine</entityname.sgt_10mmmagext>
  <entitydescription.sgt_10mmmagext>Holding 20 rounds of 10x25mm, some weapons cannot use this magazine due to it's bulky nature, though the separatists accounted for this in their designs.</entitydescription.sgt_10mmmagext>
  <entityname.sgt_s63>Renegade Light Machine Gun</entityname.sgt_s63>
  <entitydescription.sgt_s63>Another work-around to use Coalition ammunition stores, this 5.56x45 LMG can take both Coalition standard rifle magazines and belt boxes. It's assembly is crude at best, so don't expect much from it.</entitydescription.sgt_s63>
  <entityname.sgt_medgas>Sedative Gas Grenade</entityname.sgt_medgas>
  <entitydescription.sgt_medgas>A deployable canister of Chloral Hydrate, used to knock out P.O.I. without injury and allow easier apprehension. The dispersion is quick, but inefficient.</entitydescription.sgt_medgas>
  <entityname.sgt_ext>Pocket Fire Extinguisher</entityname.sgt_ext>
  <entitydescription.sgt_ext>A single-use mini extinguisher, meant to put out fires before they have a chance to take-off.</entitydescription.sgt_ext>
  <entityname.sgt_toolbox>Toolkit</entityname.sgt_toolbox>
  <entitydescription.sgt_toolbox>A toolbox containing everything needed for repairs and fieldwork, with a few open pockets for stowing additional supplies. It's made of Iron. It's very Robust.</entitydescription.sgt_toolbox>
  <entityname.sgt_wrench>Utility Wrench</entityname.sgt_wrench>
  <entitydescription.sgt_wrench>A stronger and more balanced durasteel wrench.</entitydescription.sgt_wrench>
  <entityname.sgt_henrytac>Prototype Repeater</entityname.sgt_henrytac>
  <entitydescription.sgt_henrytac>A heavily updated, multi-calibre Repeater capable of chambering 9x29, 9x33 and 10.9x33, making it significantly more versatile at the cost of a complicated lever and bolt system that needs some decent skill to cycle correctly.</entitydescription.sgt_henrytac>
  <entityname.sgt_crowbar>Durasteel Crowbar</entityname.sgt_crowbar>
  <entitydescription.sgt_crowbar>A weighty and durable wrecking bar made from durasteel. Sometimes it has to be a crowbar coming at them down a steel corridor.</entitydescription.sgt_crowbar>
  <entityname.sgt_syringeshotgun>Syringe Shotgun</entityname.sgt_syringeshotgun>
  <entitydescription.sgt_syringeshotgun>A design questionable by most, it discharges all of it's held syringes in a moments notice. Good for injecting concoxions or intensifying one toxin. Pressure chambers require all others to discharge before they will refill automatically.</entitydescription.sgt_syringeshotgun>
  <entityname.sgt_rifle>Renegade Semi-Auto Rifle</entityname.sgt_rifle>
  <entitydescription.sgt_rifle>A stark comparison to the more reliable bolt-action Coalition counterpart, it has a deeper internal magazine, with a self-actuating bolt. The gas system is incredibly rudimentary, and pulls enough away from the round to cause decreased performance.</entitydescription.sgt_rifle>
  <entityname.sgt_rifleprototype>Prototype Automatic Rifle</entityname.sgt_rifleprototype>
  <entitydescription.sgt_rifleprototype>A more dated design, with some odd touches, it uses a hinged magazine with intent to be fed .30 caliber rounds individually. It's barrel assembly was never truly finished, as it's rifling causes some rounds to yaw in-air, losing penetrative power in the process.</entitydescription.sgt_rifleprototype>
  <entityname.scp_t5000>Coalition Precision Rifle</entityname.scp_t5000>
  <entitydescription.scp_t5000>A large 8.6x70mm rifle designed for quickly and precisely taking out a single person, it is a rare sight on Europa given it's long range nich is very situational.</entitydescription.scp_t5000>
  <entityname.scp_t5000boxmag>Precision Rifle Magazine</entityname.scp_t5000boxmag>
  <entitydescription.scp_t5000boxmag>A small 5 round 8.6x70mm box magazine containing FMJ ammunition.</entitydescription.scp_t5000boxmag>
  <entityname.scp_86projectile>8.6x70mm round</entityname.scp_86projectile>
  <entityname.scp_m24>Renegade Precision Rifle</entityname.scp_m24>
  <entitydescription.scp_m24>An 8.6x70mm rifle made to be an alternative to the Coalition's more fine-crafted Precision Rifle. The cartridge's recoil is intense as it clearly was a design that wasn't meant to use it.</entitydescription.scp_m24>
